<!-- Angular in work environment it's not the same as angular in a regular environment:
  Companies are usualy reluctant to update their old angular, angular is a fast updating language and it's finding new ways to improve rapidly
  Angular pre 16 == Old angular
Angular has a strong community: "The Angular Way" where the community decides what is the best solution for each type of problem, different from
  React that depends on the expierence and expertise of the developer to find the righ library to find a solution
  This community decide on adding "Directives" like an ngIf, to add an extra functionality to an element that don't have
ChangeDectectionStrategy => OnPush, it only detects changes to that specific component instead of the whole DOM or branch like ZoneJs does
  This is not sustainaible because you have to do this to all componentes, so ZoneJs goes, and instead they introduce Signals
Signals use the concept of resumability, resumability instead of sending HTML + JS and then hidrate, it sends HTML and a Json, a script inside the html

Reactive Programming (RxJs): 
  Channels, Spectators and Events
  Signals == Channels
